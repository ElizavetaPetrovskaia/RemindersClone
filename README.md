# ReminderClone 
This is a simple iOS application that I developed as my first project using Swift. The app is a clone of the Reminders app that comes pre-installed on Apple devices.

Getting Started

To get started with this project, simply clone the repository to your local machine and open it in Xcode. 
From there, you can run the app in the iOS Simulator or on a physical iOS device.

Features

The ReminderClone app features the following:

Adding new reminders with a title, date, and time
Editing existing reminders
Deleting reminders
Marking reminders as complete
Sorting reminders by date
Technology Used

The app was developed using the following technologies:

Swift 5
UIKit
Xcode 12
Challenges Faced

As this was my first experience of writing on Swift, I faced a few challenges while developing the app. 
The biggest challenge was getting used to the syntax and structure of Swift, as well as learning how to use Xcode effectively. 
However, with practice and the help of online resources, I was able to overcome these challenges and complete the app.

Conclusion

Overall, I had a great experience developing the ReminderClone app, and it helped me to get started with Swift development. 
I hope that this app can be useful for those who are also new to Swift and iOS development. 
If you have any feedback or suggestions, please feel free to reach out to me.
